      <h1>The truth about the earth’s shape — What the Bible says</h1>
      <p class="note">Theme: The truth about the earth’s shape — What does the Bible say? Scripture reading: Isaiah 40:22</p>
      <p class="quote">“He sits above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers.” — Isaiah 40:22</p>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Many people believe what the world’s systems teach — that the earth is a ball spinning on its axis and moving through space. But what does the Bible actually say? Is that world picture the full truth, or does the Bible give us something different to consider?
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe God is our Creator, and that His Word is the final authority. In this page, we look at what the Bible says about the earth’s shape and how some simple logic is used by people who argue the earth is not what we were taught.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="biblical-evidence">
      <h2>Biblical points often used to argue for a flat, fixed earth</h2>

      <h3>1) The earth is fixed and does not move</h3>
      <p class="quote">“He set the earth on its foundations; it shall never be moved.” — Psalm 104:5</p>
      <p>
        People read this as saying the earth is set and unmoving, not spinning or orbiting the sun.
      </p>

      <h3>2) A firm dome above</h3>
      <p class="quote">“Can you, with Him, spread out the sky, hard as a cast metal mirror?” — Job 37:18</p>
      <p>
        This is read as describing a stretched, firm dome above the earth.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Corners or ends of the earth</h3>
      <p class="quote">“I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth.” — Revelation 7:1</p>
      <p>
        If the earth were only a ball, some argue “corners” would make no sense, pointing to a flat or spread‑out land.
      </p>

      <h3>4) Seeing all kingdoms at once</h3>
      <p class="quote">“The devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment.” — Matthew 4:8</p>
      <p>
        People say this scene is easier to imagine on a flat world than on a globe.
      </p>

      <h3>5) The heavens spread like a tent</h3>
      <p class="quote">“He stretches out the heavens like a thin cloth, and spreads them like a tent to dwell in.” — Isaiah 40:22</p>
      <p>
        A tent‑like covering is used by some to support a flat earth with a covering above.
      </p>

    <section id="logical-arguments">
      <h2>Simple arguments people use for a flat earth</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Horizon at eye level:</strong> Wherever you travel, the horizon seems to rise to eye level. On a globe, people argue it should curve down.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flight paths:</strong> Planes fly straight and don’t “nose down” for curvature, which some say shows a flat plane.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Antarctic ice boundary:</strong> The claim is Antarctica is a vast ice edge that holds in the oceans, with strict limits on travel reinforcing this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No visible curve:</strong> Even at high altitude, people argue the horizon looks flat in footage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Water finds level:</strong> Water seeks its level, and people say oceans cannot curve around a ball.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">These are claims made by flat‑earth supporters; others disagree and provide counter‑arguments.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="misleading">
      <h2>Why do some say we are misled?</h2>
      <p>
        Some believe the round‑earth model is part of a bigger effort to pull people away from God and toward human theories. They say the idea of a random, evolving universe removes God from the picture and moves trust into institutions and “science,” instead of Scripture.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="response">
      <h2>How should we respond?</h2>
      <p>
        Many people choose to place God’s Word above human ideas. It’s important to read Scripture with an open mind and seek truth, praying for wisdom and discernment.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.” — Proverbs 3:5–6</p>
      <p>
        Be honest about what you believe and why you believe it. Test ideas against Scripture and lived reality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="closing">
      <h2>Closing thought</h2>
      <p>
        Some say the Bible is clear about a fixed, covered earth; others say the language is figurative. Each reader must decide whether to trust Scripture over the mainstream model. This page collects the verses and arguments people use so that you can consider them directly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="prayer">
      <h2>Prayer</h2>
      <p class="quote">
        “Lord, give me wisdom to understand Your truth and to believe what Your Word says. Help me not to be misled by worldly teachings, but to stay faithful to Your creation and promises. Amen.”

        Homer’s world is a flat disk ringed by ocean. Later, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle argued for a spherical earth.
      </p>

      <h3>Islamic texts and tafsir</h3>

        A flat, circular earth with Mount Meru at the center and layered heavens and hells above and below.

      <p class="note">
        Summary claim often repeated: “Most ancient sources use flat‑earth imagery.” Others dispute the percentage and argue many ancient texts are symbolic.
