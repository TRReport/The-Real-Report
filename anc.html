      <h2>Where was the ANC in Plastic City?</h2>
      <p>
        When Plastic City was torn down in October 2025, the bulldozers rolled in, SAPS and metro police stood by, 
        and families were left in the dust. The DA rushed to claim credit. Local figures like Vlam were named as drivers of the removal.  
        But **where was the ANC?**  
      </p>
      <p>
        No strong voice. No clear plan. No presence on the ground.  
        The party that calls itself the liberation movement was nowhere to be seen when one of Brakpan’s poorest communities was erased.

      <h2>Another Night with Candles</h2>
      <p>
        The nickname says it all. For years, residents have joked bitterly that ANC stands for 
        <strong>“Another Night with Candles.”</strong> Load‑shedding has become the daily reality.  
        Shops lose stock, families lose food, children study by torchlight.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And while people sit in the dark, leaders talk about “plans” and “stability” that never arrive.  
        The lights go out, and the silence grows louder.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions the ANC won’t answer</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Why were they absent when Plastic City was demolished?</li>
        <li>Why do they promise power but deliver candles?</li>
        <li>Why do they speak of progress while communities collapse?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These questions hang in the air, unanswered. And every blackout, every silence, makes them harder to ignore.
