      <h2>Official DA statements</h2>
      <p>
        After the demolition of Plastic City, DA ward councillor <strong>Brandon Pretorius</strong> told the press that 
        “100% of the structures have been removed” and that “the real work begins now” with a 10‑point rehabilitation plan[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.citizen.co.za/brakpan-herald/news-headlines/2025/10/15/rehab-plan-in-motion-2/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054&citationId=1 "The Citizen").

      <h2>Community reality</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Families were left homeless with no relocation plan.</li>
        <li>Illegal mining continues in nearby areas, untouched.</li>
        <li>Residents say the DA claimed victory while ignoring the suffering on the ground.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many locals feel the DA used Plastic City as a photo‑op and political credit grab, not as a real solution.

      <h2>The Pretorius problem</h2>
      <p>
        Councillor Brandon Pretorius’s name has become tied to the demolition. For some residents, his statements felt like 
        celebrating destruction rather than helping people. This has left a bitter taste — even those who share his surname 
        feel embarrassed by the association.

      <h2>Contradictions</h2>
      <p>
        The DA said the demolition was about safety and progress. But:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No clear relocation or housing was provided.</li>
        <li>Police and metro officers were seen standing by while zama‑zamas carried on elsewhere.</li>
        <li>The DA took credit, but the real drivers of the removal were metro police, SAPS, contractors, and local figures like Vlam.</li>
      </ul>
