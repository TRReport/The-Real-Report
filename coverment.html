      <h2>Control and the Matrix</h2>
      <p>
        The government is not just politicians. It is the system — the Matrix.  
        Andrew Tate calls it the machine that keeps you poor, weak, and obedient.  
        It runs on rules, taxes, and fear. It tells you what to think, what to learn, and how to live.  
        The Matrix wants you to believe you are free, while you are still a slave to debt, jobs, and lies.

      <h2>Slavery never ended</h2>
      <p>
        Chains became contracts. Whips became bills. Masters became bosses.  
        Slavery is still here — only hidden under paperwork and “law.”  
        You work, you pay, you obey. That is the new slavery.

      <h2>School as a trap</h2>
      <p>
        The Bible never said you must go to school. The people of God learned by living, by faith, by wisdom.  
        Today, school is built to train obedience, not creativity.  
        A baby learns to walk by falling and trying again. If you punish him for falling, he will never walk.  
        That is what school does: punish mistakes, kill creativity, and reward silence.

      <h2>Money and control</h2>
      <p>
        Rich Dad Poor Dad teaches: the poor work for money, the rich make money work for them.  
        The government wants you in the first group — working, paying, never free.  
        That is why taxes rise, debt grows, and jobs shrink.  
        The Matrix feeds on your labour and your fear.

      <h2>Biblical truth</h2>
      <p>
        Luke’s gospel shows Jesus warning against serving two masters.  
        You cannot serve both God and money. Yet the system forces you to serve money every day.  
        The Bible shows freedom in faith, not in slavery to rulers.

      <h2>Questions that remain</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If the government is for the people, why are people always in debt?</li>
        <li>If school is for learning, why does it kill creativity?</li>
        <li>If freedom is real, why do we feel trapped in the Matrix?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These questions are left hanging. The answers are not in speeches or promises.  
        They are in breaking free from the system itself.
