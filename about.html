      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Real Report was created to keep record of what really happens in our communities — not just the official stories, but the lived truth. 
        Too often, events are rewritten, watered down, or ignored. This site is here to preserve testimony, evidence, and context so that no one can say “we didn’t know.”

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Document:</strong> Collect photos, videos, and first‑hand accounts from people on the ground.</li>
        <li><strong>Expose:</strong> Show the gap between official statements and what really happened.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserve:</strong> Build a permanent record so future generations can see the truth for themselves.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We don’t claim to be neutral. We stand with the people who live through these events. 
        We use plain language, clear evidence, and community voices. 
        Every page is built to be accessible, responsive, and easy to navigate — because truth should never be hidden behind complexity.

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        The Real Report is a community‑driven project. It is built by people who live here, who see what happens, and who refuse to let the record be erased. 
        We are not funded by government or political parties. We are independent, and we answer only to the truth.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Without archives like this, the only story left is the one told by those in power. 
        By keeping our own record, we make sure the voices of ordinary people are not silenced. 
        This is about accountability, memory, and justice.
