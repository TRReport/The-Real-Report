      <h2>What Happened</h2>
      <p>
        In October 2025, Plastic City was demolished. Reports confirm that <strong>Ekurhuleni Metro Police, SAPS, and municipal contractors</strong> were on site. 
        But locals also say <strong>Vlam was the main figure who drove the removal</strong>, working with his own resources and force. 
        Shacks were torn down with heavy machinery, many set on fire, and families were left displaced. The SPCA was called to rescue animals.

      <h2>Rose Tulee — Community Claims</h2>
      <p>
        Locals point to <strong>Rose Tulee</strong> in Minnebron. They say it has grown quickly, adding new features like a tennis area. 
        The claim is that money from illegal mining is being mixed with normal business income, making everything look legitimate. 
        These are <strong>community claims</strong>, not proven facts, but they are part of the story people tell.
      </p>

      <h2>Springs Conflict</h2>
      <p>
        Community members also say that after the demolition, groups from Springs came looking for revenge. 
        They claim there was an attempt to shoot at a man connected to the removals, because the loss of Plastic City cut off money from gold. 
        These accounts describe white gunmen involved in the attack. Again, these are <strong>community reports</strong>.

      <h2>Underground Tunnels & Collusion</h2>
      <p>
        Residents talk about underground tunnels running under Brakpan, even under the FNB bank. 
        They believe government officials and police have looked the other way because money was flowing from illegal mining. 
        Parties like the DA and VF Plus are accused of wanting credit for the demolition while ignoring the deeper corruption. 
        These claims remain unverified but are widely repeated in the community.
